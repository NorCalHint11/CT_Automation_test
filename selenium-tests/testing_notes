--Framework choice--
I have to chose to use php-webdriver to completed the below automation tests. I have decided to use a set of libraries,
steward. The details can be found at the following link:  https://github.com/lmc-eu/steward
It uses both php-webdriver and php-unit to complete the tests
This has great features for reporting test results and shortening some of the longer complex items. It also has great
integration with systems such as Jenkins.

--Test Execution--
To execute these automation test runs the following command has to be run within the directory.

    $ /vendor/bin/steward run test chrome  --group ClickTripz  -vvv

--Results--
Currently, a "result.xml" file is located in the "logs' directory. This file can be opened in any browser to see quick
test results. This has been used in the past to quickly send the file to upper management to see results, without long
details. Screen captures and URL capture files are located in the "Logs" directory as well for review.

--Docker--
The docker file is also located with in this framework. You will see it is setup for chrome and firefox. The current
command to use the docker on chrome is the following:

    $ docker run -p 4444:4444  selenium/standalone-chrome-debug

if you need to see it run on a VNC, you can use the following:

    $ docker run -p 4444:4444 -p 5900:5900  selenium/standalone-chrome-debug

-- Possibly bug found --
Also, would like to mention a possible bug found.
On chrome(version 67.0.3396.99), both of these tests have an issue after clicking the "Search" button. The second
window "Exit Unit window" does not completely load until you click on the Parent "Search" window once again. This very
well could be an issue with chrome. I am able to replicate manually as well.
